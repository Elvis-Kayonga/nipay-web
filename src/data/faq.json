    "question": "How do you assess my credit?",
    "answer": "We analyze your mobile money transaction history from the past six months. Our AI-powered algorithm looks at income patterns, transaction frequency, business seasonality, and other factors to determine your creditworthiness and overdraft limitâ€”all without requiring traditional credit history or paperwork."

  {
    "question": "What if I don't use all my limit?",
    "answer": "You only pay interest on the amount you actually use, not on your entire approved limit. There are no commitment fees or charges for unused portions of your credit line. This makes NiPay extremely flexible for businesses with variable capital needs."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I repay early?",
    "answer": "While the system automatically deducts a small percentage from your incoming mobile money payments, you can always make voluntary repayments to reduce your balance faster through the NiPay app or USSD. Early repayments incur no penalties and can help you save on interest charges."
